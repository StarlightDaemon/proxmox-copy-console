# Decisions

This file records durable decisions represented by the 0.3.0 baseline. Future ideas are not accepted merely because they are listed as possible 0.4.0 work.

## Product scope and simplicity

The product has one job: copy the intended Proxmox console's retained text accurately through one native Copy button. Firefox + Violentmonkey is the maintainer's primary daily homelab combination; Chrome compatibility remains required.

Accept an addition only when it solves a demonstrated problem in that copying workflow and its benefit justifies the code, permissions, interface, and ongoing maintenance it adds. Prioritize correctness, reliable targeting, useful failure feedback, and small compatibility fixes. Optional copying features need evidence of recurring use; a plausible idea alone does not put one on the roadmap.

Keep one readable installable file, no runtime dependencies, and no required build step. The existing 20 KiB check is a review ceiling, not room to fill. Prefer removing duplication or an unnecessary branch over creating abstractions for hypothetical future uses. Tests and probes stay outside the shipped runtime; keep documentation focused and avoid duplicating policy across new files.

## Accepted for 0.3.0

### Use explicit full-buffer copying instead of selection-driven copying

**Decision:** Copy terminal content only when the user activates the dedicated **Copy** control, and derive the copied text from xterm's retained buffer.

**Rationale:** The earlier select-to-copy lineage exposed browser/Firefox selection incompatibility with the xterm interaction model. A probe also found that xterm `getSelection()` was already populated before `onSelectionChange()` ran. The project therefore stopped using selection events as the copying foundation.

### Integrate through native ExtJS controls

**Decision:** Insert a real `Ext.button.Button` immediately after the visible Proxmox **Shell** or **Console** control.

**Rationale:** Proxmox then owns button dimensions, theme, hover behavior, and toolbar layout. Button text remains **Copy** so feedback does not cause width/reflow changes.

### Rediscover the active terminal instead of retaining one terminal reference

**Decision:** Resolve the visible xterm terminal fresh when needed and periodically re-evaluate installation state.

**Rationale:** Proxmox can create, hide, destroy, and recreate console frames/components while navigating. Fresh discovery avoids relying on a stale terminal object.

### Reconstruct logical lines from the retained xterm buffer

**Decision:** Read physical buffer rows, concatenate rows marked `isWrapped`, trim right-side padding only after a logical line is complete, and remove only trailing empty logical rows.

### Distinguish normal and alternate buffers

**Decision:** Use the normal buffer for ordinary shell operation so retained scrollback is included. When the alternate buffer is active, copy that active alternate buffer because it represents the current alternate-screen display.

## Accepted for 0.4.0

These choices were implemented in 0.4.0-dev.2 and promoted without runtime changes after the maintainer's live node/LXC copy-paste acceptance on 2026-09-18. They do not revise the historical 0.3.0 baseline. The maintainer's promotion decision accepts that observed workflow; the broader browser/manager qualification plan remains open in `docs/TESTING.md`.

- **Bind to console ownership and exact identity.** Use native `pveConsoleButton` metadata and the owner's frame descendants. Resolve the loaded URL and terminal afresh per click; decline ambiguous or unsupported contexts. English labels and global-frame fallbacks cannot establish ownership.
- **Preserve Unicode whitespace and distinguish wide-wrap placeholders.** Keep the ASCII-padding cleanup policy explicit. Use public buffer/cell APIs and current display columns, without changing terminal options or using xterm private internals.
- **Report the strength of clipboard evidence.** Await a supported callback/promise; label void-returning dispatch unconfirmed. Do not add clipboard reading, automatic retries, a fallback API chain, or an automatic clearing timer. A timeout is uncertainty and does not cancel an extension write.
- **Keep polling simple.** Skip hidden documents and scan on visibility return. Keep the 500 ms foreground interval until actual traces justify changing it. Never extract buffer rows on idle scans.
- **Keep one installable file with no runtime dependencies.** Tests may download a pinned, verified Proxmox xterm bundle into ignored `.cache/`. Node built-ins provide the test/check tools, and CI uses pinned actions with read-only permissions.
- **Restore focus conservatively.** Only the same focused button and same active terminal qualify. Do not intercept terminal keyboard shortcuts.
- **Keep trust configuration outside a new settings system.** Document manager-level host restrictions; preserve userscript identity and do not introduce an auto-update channel.
- **Target rolling stable platforms, Firefox first.** Current stable Proxmox VE with its standard console packages is the intended platform. Firefox is the primary development/acceptance browser for the maintainer's daily homelab workflow; Chrome is the secondary compatibility target. Both require evidence before claiming cross-browser qualification. The maintainer approved 0.4.0 promotion on the reported live workflow while remaining matrix coverage stays open. Prioritize Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey and test additional manager families separately. Do not maintain legacy-version shims speculatively.
- **Share one implementation across managers.** Select legacy/modern clipboard capabilities before a write; export Firefox callbacks/configuration only when the sandbox provides `cloneInto`. Keep callbacks free of page arguments and privileged return values. Add a generated variant only when an actual manager incompatibility requires one; do not maintain ten manual forks to match an arbitrary app count. See [Compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Deferred

### Compatibility test scope clarified 2026-09-19

Keep a shared source where small, evidenced compatibility changes suffice. Offer generated manager-specific variants only if shared behavior cannot remain reliable and lean; separate editions need their own acceptance. Stable 0.4.1 retains the 0.4.1-dev.1 runtime that addresses FireMonkey callback boundaries without requiring a manager fork. Practical passes for all four primary browser/manager combinations are recorded in Testing; promotion does not imply full edge-case qualification.

Use Chrome as the representative Chromium test browser. Other Chromium browsers are expected-compatible by maintainer policy, with no routine broad test matrix, but remain unverified unless actually exercised. Investigate a derivative browser when a concrete report warrants it. Both primary Chrome managers now have operator-reported candidate workflow passes; preserve their evidence limits in Testing.

After those Chrome passes, the maintainer narrowed active testing to Firefox and Chrome with Violentmonkey and Tampermonkey. Firefox + Violentmonkey remains the daily-use priority. Defer further extended-manager testing unless explicitly requested or needed for a concrete copying defect; preserve existing reports and shared compatibility code. Additional managers and probes are not release gates for practical workflow acceptance. Keep exact-version and full-scenario qualification distinct from that acceptance. Do not patch unrelated Proxmox form markup, unload handling, or suppress browser warnings in this userscript.

Viewport-only copying is an uncommitted idea, not a planned feature. Revisit only if daily use demonstrates a need, then define scrolled-viewport semantics, wrapped edges, and an accessible activation method within the simplicity policy. No broad compatibility fallback is added without probe evidence from the target installation.
